I would like to thank prof. Pier \textsc{Donini}, my research supervisor, and his team, for their patient guidance and useful critique of this project, and allowing me to choose my own project topic and goals.

I would also like to thank prof. Jean-François \textsc{Hêche} for his help on uniformly distributed number generation algorithms. My grateful thanks are also extended to prof. Alfred \textsc{Flückiger} for giving me access to his exceptional photography work and allowing me to use his panoramic photograph of the school premises for my promotional poster.

My completion of this project could not have been accomplished without the support of my classmates, Rui \textsc{Reis} and Jonathan \textsc{Bischof}, for the stimulating conversations, constantly motivating me, providing me great advice, and all the fun we had in the last two years.

Last but not the least, I wish to thank my family and partner for their support and encouragement throughout my study and my life in general.
