We describe a version of this routine that uses {IEEE} numerical properties to ensure that those tests are both robust and efficient. Sample source code is available online.},

	abstract = {In analytic geometry, a line and a sphere can intersect in three ways: no intersection at all, at exactly one point, or in two points. Methods for distinguishing these cases, and determining equations for the points in the latter cases, are useful in a number of circumstances. For example, this is a common calculation to perform during ray tracing (Eberly 2006:698).},
